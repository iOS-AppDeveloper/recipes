Try the following delicious snack receipe, preferably on a warm summer afternoon, perhaps after
you've been laid off and can't find work:

1) Go to your local supermarket, or package/liquor store if you're not lucky enough to live in
a state that sells alcohol at the grocery store, and pick up a 12 pack of your favorite IPA.  If
you don't like IPAs, then this receipe isn't for you.

2) Hopefully you're still at the supermarket or package/liquor store as you haven't been directed
to do anything else yet.  C'mon people, follow the directions!  If your at the package/liquor store,
then go to your favorite supermarket/grocery store/gas station market/convenience store and then 
follow step 3.  If you're already at the supermarket with your 12 pack in hand, immediately follow step 3.

3) Find the Cookies isle and grab a package of Chips Ahoy Chocolate Chip Cookies and head for the shortest line at the cashiers.  Option A: Having found the cookies and beer, why wait?  Plunk
yourself down right there in the cookie isle and break open a nice cold brew.  Pfffft!  Whadda ya mean?!  You open it with the opener attached to your key ring.  Don't have an opener?!  Then you
really don't like beer and this receipe isn't for you.  Option B: If you're feeling energetic, go 
to the Baking isle instead and pick up a package of Nestles Chocolate Chips. Then go get all the
ingredients listed in the receipe on the back of the package.  If you go with this option, remember
that you'll have to wait in line, pay, make your way home, lug all your groceries inside, preheat
the oven while you wash the dirty dishes you need, study the directions carefully, and then do all
the work yourself to make cookies that you hopefully don't burn.  And then you have to let them 
cool.  And then you can finally eat a cookie and drink a beer...  but, oh, how heavenly do those
cookies taste!  And then to wash them down with a frothy, refreshing swig of IPA! Yum! Life is good!
